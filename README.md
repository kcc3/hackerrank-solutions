## About Me

Hello everyone!  I'm a technical artist who loves to tinker with new tech and keep myself busy coding whenever possible. My background is in computer science and envineering, and I've been in the Video Game and Animation Industry my entire career.

This repo is for the problem solving and other challenges code that I write on hackerrank.  Additionally, I'll be adding more of my project code here as I start to clean up my various projects and scripts from past work so it's all organized in one place (finally).
